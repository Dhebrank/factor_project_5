## 📈 Strategic Investment Implications

### **Regime-Aware Factor Allocation Framework**

#### **Goldilocks Period Strategy**
- **Overweight**: All factors (especially Value & Momentum)
- **Rationale**: Risk-on environment with low volatility
- **Expected Outcome**: Superior risk-adjusted returns

#### **Overheating Period Strategy**  
- **Tilt**: Value > Momentum > Quality > MinVol
- **Rationale**: Inflation rising but growth still positive
- **Expected Outcome**: Solid absolute returns with moderate risk

#### **Stagflation Period Strategy**
- **Cautious Allocation**: Slight Value bias, defensive positioning
- **Rationale**: Challenging growth & inflation dynamics
- **Expected Outcome**: Low but positive returns

#### **Recession Period Strategy**
- **Defensive Focus**: Quality & MinVol emphasis
- **Underweight**: Value (avoid cyclical stress)
- **Rationale**: Capital preservation critical
- **Expected Outcome**: Relative outperformance in down markets
