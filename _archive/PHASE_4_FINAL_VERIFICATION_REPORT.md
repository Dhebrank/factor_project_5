## 🔧 Technical Issues Resolved

### **Dynamic Recommendations Fix**
- **Issue**: Dynamic allocation recommendations were not being generated due to attribute dependency
- **Root Cause**: Method was checking for `hasattr(self, 'transition_analytics')` before it was set
- **Solution**: Modified method to generate transition analysis directly within the allocation framework
- **Result**: All tests now pass 100% ✅
